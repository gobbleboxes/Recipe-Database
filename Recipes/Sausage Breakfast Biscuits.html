        <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
            <p class="line"><strong>FOR THE TURKEY SAUSAGE:</strong></p><p class="line">In a large bowl add the turkey and all of the seasonings and brown sugar. Mix thoroughly to incorporate into the meat.</p><p class="line">In a large skillet over medium high heat, add 1 tbsp of oil and add in the turkey. Brown it on both sides and cook it until no pink color remains.</p><p class="line">Break up the sausage into small pieces and remove from the pan to set aside until you are ready for it later.</p><p class="line">FOR THE PEPPERS AND ONIONS</p><p class="line">While the sausage is cooking, wash and cut your peppers and onions. Cut them all into a small dice.</p><p class="line">Once the sausage has finished cooking, remove it from the pan and add in 1 tbsp of oil. Toss in the peppers and onions and season lightly with salt.</p><p class="line">Cook the vegetables until they release most of their water and they begin to soften and brown slightly.</p><p class="line">Once the peppers and onions are ready, you can add in the turkey sausage, turn off the heat, and mix everything together. Make sure you chop up the sausage into small pieces. You don&apos;t want big chunks of this as it will take up all of the space in your biscuit if you do.</p><p class="line">Allow this mixture to cool slightly before adding it into your biscuit dough.</p><p class="line"><strong>FOR THE BISCUITS:</strong></p><p class="line">Oat flour is simply oats blended up until they are in a flour consistency. You can buy this preground from the store but it is much more expensive than if you do it yourself. Placing rolled oats in a high powered blender for 30 seconds is all it takes.</p><p class="line">In a large bowl, mix all of the dry ingredients together. Add the oat flour, parsley, garlic powder, baking soda, and salt. Note that I have this recipe written to use 9g of salt. The amount of salt you use can be affected by the saltiness of your cheese, if you seasoned your sausage and peppers more or less than I did, or by your preference. You can always take a small taste of the dough and adjust as needed.</p><p class="line">In a separate bowl, mix together all of the wet ingredients. Add in the eggs, shredded cheese, and Greek yogurt.</p><p class="line">Dump the wet ingredients into the dry bowl and mix together. When most of the flour has been mixed in, you can dump in the sausage and peppers and continue mixing until everything is well incorporated.</p><p class="line">FORMING THE BISCUITS</p><p class="line">I got 80 biscuits out of this recipe. I had enough dough to fill 4 sheet pans. Give the sheet pans a light layer of oil or line with parchment paper to prevent stickage.</p><p class="line">To form the biscuits, I used a 1oz (30g) sized cookie scoop. This will make the process so much easier on you. If you don&apos;t have one, you can use a couple of spoons to form them into mounds, but the cookie scoop is way easier.</p><p class="line">Scoop the biscuits onto the sheet pans and give them about 2 inches of space between them. You&apos;ll likely have to bake these in batches so as you get a couple of trays filled up, you can move them into your oven.</p><p class="line">Bake at 375℉ (190℃) for 15-17 minutes or until the tops begin to turn golden brown.</p><p class="line">While the first batch is baking, continue to scoop out the remaining dough until it has all been used up. Bake the last couple of trays after the first round has completed. Allow the biscuits to cool on the counter.</p><p class="line">STORAGE</p><p class="line">Consolidate all of the biscuits onto one tray, it is okay if they are stacked on top of each other, and move them into the freezer. Freeze the biscuits uncovered until they are frozen solid to prepare for vacuum sealing.</p><p class="line">Once frozen solid, move the biscuits into a Fresh and Save bag or container, remove the air, and store in Snack City in your freezer. The flash freezing is a necessary step or else the biscuits will get smushed when you vacuum the air out.</p><p class="line">The biscuits will keep for months as long as you store them properly and keep any air out.</p><p class="line">REHEATING</p><p class="line">The biscuits can be reheated in the microwave, air fryer, or oven. If you want a softer bite, use the microwave. For a crispier biscuit, use the air fryer.</p><p class="line">I microwave the biscuits straight from the freezer for 60-90 seconds. If I air fry them, I do 7-10 minutes at 400℉.</p>
